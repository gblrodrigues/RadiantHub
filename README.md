# RadiantHub

RadiantHub is an Android application developed in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose, designed to explore agents, abilities, 
maps, and other content from Valorant.

I built this project to practice API integration, local persistence, state management, and modern Android UI 
development while exploring a more immersive visual experience.

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture (MVVM)
The project follows MVVM with a feature-based organization, keeping UI, domain, and data responsibilities separated.

ViewModels expose screen state through StateFlow, while sealed `UiState` represents loading, success, and error states.

> This structure helps reduce coupling between UI and business logic while keeping screen state predictable.

### API Consumption
The application consumes data from the Valorant public API. This allowed me to practice HTTP requests, data handling, and layer organization within the project.

This allowed me to practice:
* REST API consumption  
* DTO mapping to domain models  
* Error handling  
* UI state management for loading, success, and error scenarios

### Data Persistence (Room + DataStore)
I implemented Room for local persistence of favorite agents and DataStore for managing user personalization preferences such as theme and language selection.

### Screen Navigation (Navigation)
The application uses Navigation Compose with centralized route definitions for parameterized destinations.

Navigation responsibilities are kept separate from screen specific logic, reducing coupling between screens, `ViewModels`, and the `NavigationGraph`.

## Project Goal

This project was developed with the goal of:

* Practicing REST API consumption  
* Improving UI development with Jetpack Compose  
* Improving UI/UX thinking  
* Improving state management using ViewModel and StateFlow  
* Building a stronger Android portfolio project
